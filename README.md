# Tailwind-React todos

Everyone needs to start somewhere, right? This is my attempt at writing a todo app using TailwindCSS and React, two technologies I'm new at.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
